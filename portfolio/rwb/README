Welcome to Red, White, and Blue

This is a tiny geolocation-oriented application that integrates
political contribution and opinion data onto a map view.   

It is based on Perl CGI, DBI, an Oracle Database, and client-side
JavaScript with Google Maps.  It is instructional code to support EECS
339, Introduction to Databases in the EECS department at Northwestern
University.

Requirements
------------

You must have the following software running:

   Perl 5.8  
     CGI
     DBI
     DBI::Oracle
     Time::ParseDate
   Oracle    (tested with Oracle 11g)
   Apache    (or other web server)
   Web Browser (tested with Google Chrome)

We assume the following:
   
   machine     Name of your machine
   you         Linux username
   yourgroup   Your Linux group
   youora      Your Oracle username
   orapasswd   Your Oracle password

Your oracle account must have permissions to allow the creation of
tables and sequences, inserts, deletes, updates, and selects.  Here 
is a minimal set of sysdba commands to do this if it isn't already the
case.  These are not commands that can be executed by the 
student, but rather by the database administrator:

$ sqlplus /nolog
SQL> connect / as sysdba;
SQL> create user youora identified by orapasswd default tablespace users;
SQL> grant connect, resource to youora;
SQL> quit;

In addition to the tables that you (the student) will create, RWB also
needs to have access to the FEC data tables, which we assume are
installed in a class account, "cs339" at Northwestern.  Students must
have read access to these tables.  Again, this is set by the database
administrator.

We assume that ~you/www is served by Apache as http://machine/~you.
We also assume that ~you/www and its children are CGI-enabled and
support CGI scripts with the extension ".pl".   It is helpful if 
you are using suexec - otherwise realize that CGI programs execute as
the web server user, not as you.   We use suexec at Northwestern.

Your web browser must support JavaScript and accept cookies.  We
highly recommend using Google Chrome.  Not only is RWB tested using it,
Chrome's development tools are very useful in understanding what's 
going on.


Contents
--------

   README         This file
   rwb.sql        SQL code for creating the schema (but not the FEC tables)
   rwb.pl         Perl CGI code that implements the application on the server
   rwb.js         JavaScript, which is run by the client 
   rwb.css        Style file that describes how to skin pages
   rwb-drop.sql   How to delete RWB from the database


Installing RWB
--------------

cd www
tar xvfz rwb.tgz
cd rwb
sqlplus youora/orapasswd @rwb.sql

Now edit rwb.pl to reflect your environment.  

These lines reflect where oracle is installed:

    $ENV{ORACLE_BASE}="/raid/oracle11g/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.1.0";
    $ENV{ORACLE_HOME}=$ENV{ORACLE_BASE}."/db_1";
    $ENV{ORACLE_SID}="CS339";
    $ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}=$ENV{ORACLE_HOME}."/lib";

These lines reflect your oracle user and password:

my $dbuser="CHANGEME";
my $dbpasswd="CHANGEME";

At Northwestern, the main thing you'll need to change are these 
last two lines.

Using RWB
---------

Point a web browser at

http://machine/~you/rwb/rwb.pl

You will see a red, white, or blue banner that reflects current status, 
and a map that is centered at your location.  The map has overlayed 
upon it nearby political committees and candidates.   You can scroll
and zoom the map as desired, and the map will continuously track your
current location.  More options are available after the map.

Understanding RWB
-----------------

No matter what the assignment is, you first want to understand how
RWB works.  rwb.sql, rwb.pl, and rwb.js are extensively commented
to help you do so.   The application can also generate tons of 
debugging output.   If you include ?debug=1 at the end of the URL, 
you will see this output in your browser.  You can also change the
default in the rwb.pl script:

my $debug=1;  # 1= output debugging data, 0= do not

When you load http://machine/~you/rwb/rwb.pl, your browser sends the
request, plus any cookies RWB has previously set to the server.  The
server invokes rwb.pl and feeds it with the cookies and parameters.
Based on this input, rwb.pl produces a page that is handed back to
your browser.  The page contains references back to rwb.js, and your
browser will also fetch this, and execute it.  rwb.js finds your
current location, and creates a Google Map object on the page,
centered at your location.  It also makes an additional call back to
rwb.pl, this time asking it for political data that is nearby.  Based
on this request, rwb.pl invokes a series of SQL queries to find the
data, and then hands it back to rwb.js, which places this data on a
hidden part of the web page.  It then parses the data and overlays it
on the map.  rwb.js also installs callbacks that are invoked whenever
the geoposition, map zoom, or map center changes.  When this occurs
new data is fetched using rwb.pl and the map is redrawn. 

In addition to the map interface, the user can also click on various
links (the ones that appear depend on who he is).  These links invoke
rwb.pl to produce different web pages containing forms to allow the
input of data.  The most basic form is the login form, which allows a
user to authenticate with a password.  When the user does this, rwb.pl
also hands back a cookie that contains his credentials.  When further
invocations of rwb.pl happen, this cookie is passed back, allowing for
a persistent session.  An additional cookie, the debug cookie, is used
to turn on (or off) debugging for all invocations of rwb.pl that are
needed to build or update a page.

NOTE: Passing a cookie with an unencrypted username/password
combination is NOT a secure way of handling sessions.  First, it is
sent in cleartext and so could be intercepted.  Second, it is stored
in the browser or the browser cookie file in cleartext and so could be
vulnerable to attack there.   


Extending RWB
-------------

The first project in CS 339 involves extending RWB in various
ways.  The best way to do this is generally the following:

0. UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS FIRST
1. Write the SQL needed for the task
2. Verify that instances of the SQL work using sqlplus
3. Embed the SQL into a Perl function (look at UserAdd or Committees 
   as examples)
4. Write the Perl logic to call the function at the
   right time.
5. Finally, write the corresponding JavaScript logic, if any.
